This required a generic stack.  To read, evaluate, type convert, and prevent dereferencing variables, the StackIterator class and its assocated operator>> methods were created.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n\r\nThe author is Jonathan Seng (@nekenyu).\r\n\r\nThere are currently no other contributors.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\nDocumentation can be found in [doc/](doc/).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
